          <p>
            My name is Denise Ellison. I was born in the Middle East and grew up abroad until I was ten years old. My dad worked for an oil company, Oxy, which is why we lived in Scotland, Colombia, and Venezuela until we settled in California in 1999. Ever since I was young I was very much into living a healthy and active life. Even when I was in highschool I began cooking for my family to make sure that everyone was eating healthy balanced meals. By the time I went to college I had already written up a couple of recipe books and was excited for the opportunity to write more. Unfortunately, my life became extremely busy with work when I entered into the financial industry as an investment banker at J.P. Morgan. Four very stressful years in the workforce made me realize how incredibly important it is for one to take care of one's body. I am hopeful that this website will be an inspiration to people to eat well, live healthy and be happy. XX Denise
